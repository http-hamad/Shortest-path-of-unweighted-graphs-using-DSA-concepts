# Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Concepts

## Overview

This project focuses on finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs using fundamental concepts from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal is to implement and understand various algorithms that can efficiently compute the shortest path between two nodes in a graph where all edges have equal weight.

## Introduction

In graph theory, the shortest path problem involves finding the shortest path between two vertices in a graph. In the case of unweighted graphs, where all edges have the same weight, several algorithms can be applied to efficiently compute the shortest path.

This project explores the implementation of such algorithms using key DSA concepts, providing a foundation for understanding and applying these techniques in real-world scenarios.

## BFS Algorithm

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices at the current depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level. In the context of unweighted graphs, BFS can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you'll need:

- [Programming Language Compiler/Interpreter] - C++ complier
- [Any additional dependencies] - None
